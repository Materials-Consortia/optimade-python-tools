GENERAL_DESCRIPTION_TRAJECTORY_FIELD = """To define how this property is stored for each of the frames in the trajectory the following properties have been defined:
- **frame_serialization_format**:
  - **Description**: To improve the compactness of the data there are several ways to show to which frame a value belongs.
    This is specified by the :property:`frame_serialization_format`.
  - **Type**: string
  - **Requirements/Conventions**: This field MUST be present.
  - **Values**:
    - **constant**: The value of the property is constant and thus has the same value for each frame in the trajectory.
    - **explicit**: A value is given for each frame.
      The number of values MUST thus be equal to the number of frames and MUST be in the same order as the frames.
      If there is no value for a particular frame the value MUST be :val:`null`.
    - **linear**: The value is a linear function of the frame number.
      This function is defined by :property:`offset_linear` and :property:`step_size_linear`.
    - **explicit_regular_sparse**: The value is set every one per :property:`step_size_sparse` frames, with :property:`offset_sparse` as the first frame.
    - **explicit_custom_sparse**: A separate list with frame numbers is defined in the field :property:`sparse_frames` to indicate to which frame a value belongs.
- **offset_linear**:
  - **Description**: If :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to :val:`"linear"` this property gives the value at frame 0.
  - **Type**: float
  - **Requirements/Conventions**: The value MAY be present when :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to :val:`"linear"`, otherwise the value MUST NOT be present.
    The default value is 0.
  - **Examples**:
    - :val:`1.5`
- **step_size_linear**:
  - **Description**: If :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to :val:`"linear"`, this value gives the change in the value of the property per unit of frame number.
    e.g. If at frame 3 the value of the property is 0.6 and :property:`step_size_linear` = 0.2 than at frame 4 the value of the property will be 0.8.
  - **Type**: float
  - **Requirements/Conventions**: The value MUST be present when :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to "linear".
    Otherwise it MUST NOT be present.
  - **Examples**:
    - :val:`0.0005`
- **offset_sparse**:
  - **Description**: If :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to :val:` "explicit_regular_sparse"` this property gives the frame number to which the first value belongs.
  - **Type**: integer
  - **Requirements/Conventions**: The value MAY be present when :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to :val:`"explicit_regular_sparse"`, otherwise the value MUST NOT be present.
    The default value is 0.
  - **Examples**:
    - :val:`100`
- **step_size_sparse**:
  - **Description**: If :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to :val:` "explicit_regular_sparse"`, this value indicates that every step_size_sparse frames a value is defined.
  - **Type**: integer
  - **Requirements/Conventions**: The value MUST be present when :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to :val:`"explicit_regular_sparse"`.
    Otherwise it MUST NOT be present.
  - **Examples**:
    - :val:`100`
- **sparse_frames**:
  - **Description**: If :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to :val:`"explicit_custom_sparse"`, this field holds the frames to which the values in the value field belong.
  - **Type**: List of integers
  - **Requirements/Conventions**: The value MUST be present when :property:`frame_serialization_format` is set to "explicit_custom_sparse".
    Otherwise it MUST NOT be present.
    The frame numbers in :property:`sparse_frames` MUST be in the same order as the values.
  - **Examples**:
    - :val:`[0,20,78,345]`
- **values**:- **Description**: The values belonging to this property.
    The format of this field depends on the property and on the :property:`frame_serialization_format` parameter.
  - **Type**: List of Any
  - **Requirements/Conventions**: The value MUST be present when :property:`frame_serialization_format` is not set to :val:`"linear"`.
    If a value has not been sampled for a particular frame the value should be set to :val:`null` at the highest possible nesting level.
    In case of `cartesian_site_positions`_, a site that has the value :val:`null` for the x,y and z coordinates means that the site is not in the simulation volume.
    This may be useful for grand canonical simulations where the number of particles in the simulation volume is not constant."""

For databases that do not define an absolute Cartesian system (e.g., only defining the length and angles between vectors), the first lattice vector SHOULD be set along x and the second on the xy-plane.

Requirements/Conventions:
Support: SHOULD be supported by all implementations, i.e., SHOULD NOT be null.
Query: Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL. If supported, filters MAY support only a subset of comparison operators.
Each list member MUST be a dictionary with the following keys:
name: REQUIRED; gives the name of the species; the name value MUST be unique in the species list;
chemical_symbols: REQUIRED; MUST be a list of strings of all chemical elements composing this species. Each item of the list MUST be one of the following:
a valid chemical-element symbol, or
the special value "X" to represent a non-chemical element, or
the special value "vacancy" to represent that this site has a non-zero probability of having a vacancy (the respective probability is indicated in the concentration list, see below).
If any one entry in the species list has a chemical_symbols list that is longer than 1 element, the correct flag MUST be set in the list structure_features (see property structure_features).
concentration: REQUIRED; MUST be a list of floats, with same length as chemical_symbols. The numbers represent the relative concentration of the corresponding chemical symbol in this species. The numbers SHOULD sum to one. Cases in which the numbers do not sum to one typically fall only in the following two categories:
Numerical errors when representing float numbers in fixed precision, e.g. for two chemical symbols with concentrations 1/3 and 2/3, the concentration might look something like [0.33333333333, 0.66666666666]. If the client is aware that the sum is not one because of numerical precision, it can renormalize the values so that the sum is exactly one.
Experimental errors in the data present in the database. In this case, it is the responsibility of the client to decide how to process the data.
Note that concentrations are uncorrelated between different sites (even of the same species).
attached: OPTIONAL; if provided MUST be a list of length 1 or more of strings of chemical symbols for the elements attached to this site, or "X" for a non-chemical element.
nattached: OPTIONAL; if provided MUST be a list of length 1 or more of integers indicating the number of attached atoms of the kind specified in the value of the attached key.
The implementation MUST include either both or none of the attached and nattached keys, and if they are provided, they MUST be of the same length. Furthermore, if they are provided, the structure_features property MUST include the string site_attachments.
mass: OPTIONAL. If present MUST be a list of floats, with the same length as chemical_symbols, providing element masses expressed in a.m.u. Elements denoting vacancies MUST have masses equal to 0.
original_name: OPTIONAL. Can be any valid Unicode string, and SHOULD contain (if specified) the name of the species that is used internally in the source database.
Note: With regards to "source database", we refer to the immediate source being queried via the OPTIMADE API implementation. The main use of this field is for source databases that use species names, containing characters that are not allowed (see description of the list property species_at_sites).
For systems that have only species formed by a single chemical symbol, and that have at most one species per chemical symbol, SHOULD use the chemical symbol as species name (e.g., "Ti" for titanium, "O" for oxygen, etc.) However, note that this is OPTIONAL, and client implementations MUST NOT assume that the key corresponds to a chemical symbol, nor assume that if the species name is a valid chemical symbol, that it represents a species with that chemical symbol. This means that a species {"name": "C", "chemical_symbols": ["Ti"], "concentration": [1.0]} is valid and represents a titanium species (and not a carbon species).
It is NOT RECOMMENDED that a structure includes species that do not have at least one corresponding site.

Each species name mentioned in the species_at_sites list MUST be described in the list property species (i.e. for each value in the species_at_sites list there MUST exist exactly one dictionary in the species list with the name attribute equal to the corresponding species_at_sites value).
Each site MUST be associated only to a single species. Note: However, species can represent mixtures of atoms, and multiple species MAY be defined for the same chemical element. This latter case is useful when different atoms of the same type need to be grouped or distinguished, for instance in simulation codes to assign different initial spin states.
Examples:
["Ti","O2"] indicates that the first site is hosting a species labeled "Ti" and the second a species labeled "O2".
["Ac", "Ac", "Ag", "Ir"] indicating the first two sites contains the "Ac" species, while the third and fourth sites contain the "Ag" and "Ir" species, respectively."""
