from the specification.

- Both `filters.txt` and `optional_filters.txt.` are automatically
generated files containing all examples from the specification. It
is generated using the `invoke` task `parse_spec_for_filters`.

When being loaded in, these filter examples are also made more concrete
by replacing references to vague `values`/`value` with specific examples.
