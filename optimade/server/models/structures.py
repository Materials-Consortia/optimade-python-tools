     * No spaces or separators are allowed.

    * **Requirements/Conventions**:
      * This property is REQUIRED, except when [6.2.5. `dimension_types`](#h.6.2.5) is equal to
        `[0, 0, 0]` (in this case it is OPTIONAL).
      * It MUST be a list of three vectors *a*, *b*, and *c*, where each of the vectors MUST BE a list of
        the vector's coordinates along the x, y, and z Cartesian coordinates. (Therefore, the first index
        runs over the three lattice vectors and the second index runs over the x, y, z Cartesian
        coordinates).
      * For databases that do not define an absolute Cartesian system (e.g., only defining the length and
        angles between vectors), the first lattice vector SHOULD be set along `x` and the second on the `xy`
        plane.
      * This property MUST be an array of dimensions 3 times 3 regardless of the elements of
        [6.2.5. `dimension_types`](#h.6.2.5). The vectors SHOULD by convention be chosen so the determinant
        of the `lattice_vectors` matrix is different from zero. The vectors in the non-periodic directions
        have no significance beyond fulfilling these requirements.
    * **Examples**:
      * `[[4.,0.,0.],[0.,4.,0.],[0.,1.,4.]]` represents a cell, where the first vector is
        `(4, 0, 0)`, i.e., a vector aligned along the `x` axis of length 4 Ã…; the second vector is
        `(0, 4, 0)`; and the third vector is `(0, 1, 4)`.
