            "description": "A list describing the species of the sites of this structure.\nSpecies can represent pure chemical elements, virtual-crystal atoms representing a statistical occupation of a given site by multiple chemical elements, and/or a location to which there are attached atoms, i.e., atoms whose precise location are unknown beyond that they are attached to that position (frequently used to indicate hydrogen atoms attached to another element, e.g., a carbon with three attached hydrogens might represent a methyl group, -CH3).\n\n- **Type**: list of dictionary with keys:\n    - `name`: string (REQUIRED)\n    - `chemical_symbols`: list of strings (REQUIRED)\n    - `concentration`: list of float (REQUIRED)\n    - `attached`: list of strings (REQUIRED)\n    - `nattached`: list of integers (OPTIONAL)\n    - `mass`: list of floats (OPTIONAL)\n    - `original_name`: string (OPTIONAL).\n\n- **Requirements/Conventions**:\n    - **Support**: SHOULD be supported by all implementations, i.e., SHOULD NOT be `null`.\n    - **Query**: Support for queries on this property is OPTIONAL.\n        If supported, filters MAY support only a subset of comparison operators.\n    - Each list member MUST be a dictionary with the following keys:\n        - **name**: REQUIRED; gives the name of the species; the **name** value MUST be unique in the `species` list;\n        - **chemical_symbols**: REQUIRED; MUST be a list of strings of all chemical elements composing this species.\n          Each item of the list MUST be one of the following:\n            - a valid chemical-element symbol, or\n            - the special value `\"X\"` to represent a non-chemical element, or\n            - the special value `\"vacancy\"` to represent that this site has a non-zero probability of having a vacancy (the respective probability is indicated in the `concentration` list, see below).\n\n          If any one entry in the `species` list has a `chemical_symbols` list that is longer than 1 element, the correct flag MUST be set in the list `structure_features`.\n\n        - **concentration**: REQUIRED; MUST be a list of floats, with same length as `chemical_symbols`.\n          The numbers represent the relative concentration of the corresponding chemical symbol in this species.\n          The numbers SHOULD sum to one. Cases in which the numbers do not sum to one typically fall only in the following two categories:\n\n            - Numerical errors when representing float numbers in fixed precision, e.g. for two chemical symbols with concentrations `1/3` and `2/3`, the concentration might look something like `[0.33333333333, 0.66666666666]`. If the client is aware that the sum is not one because of numerical precision, it can renormalize the values so that the sum is exactly one.\n            - Experimental errors in the data present in the database. In this case, it is the responsibility of the client to decide how to process the data.\n\n            Note that concentrations are uncorrelated between different sites (even of the same species).\n\n        - **attached**: OPTIONAL; if provided MUST be a list of length 1 or more of strings of chemical symbols for the elements attached to this site, or \"X\" for a non-chemical element.\n\n        - **nattached**: OPTIONAL; if provided MUST be a list of length 1 or more of integers indicating the number of attached atoms of the kind specified in the value of the `attached` key.\n\n          The implementation MUST include either both or none of the `attached` and `nattached` keys, and if they are provided, they MUST be of the same length.\n          Furthermore, if they are provided, the `structure_features` property MUST include the string `site_attachments`.\n\n        - **mass**: OPTIONAL. If present MUST be a list of floats, with the same length as `chemical_symbols`, providing element masses expressed in a.m.u.\n          Elements denoting vacancies MUST have masses equal to 0.\n\n        - **original_name**: OPTIONAL. Can be any valid Unicode string, and SHOULD contain (if specified) the name of the species that is used internally in the source database.\n\n          Note: With regards to \"source database\", we refer to the immediate source being queried via the OPTIMADE API implementation.\n\n          The main use of this field is for source databases that use species names, containing characters that are not allowed (see description of the list property `species_at_sites`).\n\n    - For systems that have only species formed by a single chemical symbol, and that have at most one species per chemical symbol, SHOULD use the chemical symbol as species name (e.g., `\"Ti\"` for titanium, `\"O\"` for oxygen, etc.)\n      However, note that this is OPTIONAL, and client implementations MUST NOT assume that the key corresponds to a chemical symbol, nor assume that if the species name is a valid chemical symbol, that it represents a species with that chemical symbol.\n      This means that a species `{\"name\": \"C\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Ti\"], \"concentration\": [1.0]}` is valid and represents a titanium species (and *not* a carbon species).\n    - It is NOT RECOMMENDED that a structure includes species that do not have at least one corresponding site.\n\n- **Examples**:\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"Ti\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Ti\"], \"concentration\": [1.0]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a Ti atom.\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"Ti\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Ti\", \"vacancy\"], \"concentration\": [0.9, 0.1]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a Ti atom with 90 % probability, and has a vacancy with 10 % probability.\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"BaCa\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"vacancy\", \"Ba\", \"Ca\"], \"concentration\": [0.05, 0.45, 0.5], \"mass\": [0.0, 137.327, 40.078]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a Ba atom with 45 % probability, a Ca atom with 50 % probability, and by a vacancy with 5 % probability. The mass of this site is (on average) 88.5 a.m.u.\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"C12\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"mass\": [12.0]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a carbon isotope with mass 12.\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"C13\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"mass\": [13.0]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a carbon isotope with mass 13.\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"CH3\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"attached\": [\"H\"], \"nattached\": [3]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a methyl group, -CH3, which is represented without specifying precise positions of the hydrogen atoms.",

These two sites are correlated (either site 0 or 1 is present). Similarly, site 2 is present with a probability of 30 % and site 3 with a probability of 70 %.\n        These two sites are correlated (either site 2 or 3 is present).\n        However, the presence or absence of sites 0 and 1 is not correlated with the presence or absence of sites 2 and 3 (in the specific example, the pair of sites (0, 2) can occur with 0.2*0.3 = 6 % probability; the pair (0, 3) with 0.2*0.7 = 14 % probability; the pair (1, 2) with 0.8*0.3 = 24 % probability; and the pair (1, 3) with 0.8*0.7 = 56 % probability).",

In particular, this property MUST explicitly provide all symmetry operations needed to generate all the atoms in the unit cell from the atoms in the asymmetric unit, for the setting used.\n    - This symmetry operation set MUST always include the `x,y,z` identity operation.\n    - The symmetry operations are to be applied to fractional atom coordinates. In case only Cartesian coordinates are available, these Cartesian coordinates must be converted to fractional coordinates before the application of the provided symmetry operations.\n    - If the symmetry operation list is present, it MUST be compatible with other space group specifications (e.g. the ITC space group number, the Hall symbol, the Hermann-Mauguin symbol) if these are present.\n\n- **Examples**:\n    - Space group operations for the space group with ITC number 3 (H-M symbol `P 2`, extended H-M symbol `P 1 2 1`, Hall symbol `P 2y`): `[\"x,y,z\", \"-x,y,-z\"]`\n    - Space group operations for the space group with ITC number 5 (H-M symbol `C 2`, extended H-M symbol `C 1 2 1`, Hall symbol `C 2y`): `[\"x,y,z\", \"-x,y,-z\", \"x+1/2,y+1/2,z\", \"-x+1/2,y+1/2,-z\"]`\n\n- **Notes**: The list of space group symmetry operations applies to the whole periodic array of atoms and together with the lattice translations given in the `lattice_vectors` property provides the necessary information to reconstruct all atom site positions of the periodic material.\n  Thus, the symmetry operations described in this property are only applicable to material models with at least one periodic dimension.\n  This property is not meant to represent arbitrary symmetries of molecules, non-periodic (finite) collections of atoms or non-crystallographic symmetry.\n\n- **Bibliographic References**:\n  - Bradley, C.

The mass of this site is (on average) 88.5 a.m.u.\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"C12\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"mass\": [12.0]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a carbon isotope with mass 12.\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"C13\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"mass\": [13.0]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a carbon isotope with mass 13.\n    - `[ {\"name\": \"CH3\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"attached\": [\"H\"], \"nattached\": [3]} ]`: any site with this species is occupied by a methyl group, -CH3, which is represented without specifying precise positions of the hydrogen atoms.",

These two sites are correlated (either site 0 or 1 is present). Similarly, site 2 is present with a probability of 30 % and site 3 with a probability of 70 %.\n        These two sites are correlated (either site 2 or 3 is present).\n        However, the presence or absence of sites 0 and 1 is not correlated with the presence or absence of sites 2 and 3 (in the specific example, the pair of sites (0, 2) can occur with 0.2*0.3 = 6 % probability; the pair (0, 3) with 0.2*0.7 = 14 % probability; the pair (1, 2) with 0.8*0.3 = 24 % probability; and the pair (1, 3) with 0.8*0.7 = 56 % probability).",

The main use of this field is for source databases that use species names, containing characters that are not allowed (see description of the list property species_at_sites).\nFor systems that have only species formed by a single chemical symbol, and that have at most one species per chemical symbol, SHOULD use the chemical symbol as species name (e.g., \"Ti\" for titanium, \"O\" for oxygen, etc.) However, note that this is OPTIONAL, and client implementations MUST NOT assume that the key corresponds to a chemical symbol, nor assume that if the species name is a valid chemical symbol, that it represents a species with that chemical symbol. This means that a species {\"name\": \"C\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Ti\"], \"concentration\": [1.0]} is valid and represents a titanium species (and not a carbon species).\nIt is NOT RECOMMENDED that a structure includes species that do not have at least one corresponding site.\nExamples:\n\n[ {\"name\": \"Ti\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Ti\"], \"concentration\": [1.0]} ]: any site with this species is occupied by a Ti atom.\n[ {\"name\": \"Ti\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Ti\", \"vacancy\"], \"concentration\": [0.9, 0.1]} ]: any site with this species is occupied by a Ti atom with 90 % probability, and has a vacancy with 10 % probability.\n[ {\"name\": \"BaCa\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"vacancy\", \"Ba\", \"Ca\"], \"concentration\": [0.05, 0.45, 0.5], \"mass\": [0.0, 137.327, 40.078]} ]: any site with this species is occupied by a Ba atom with 45 % probability, a Ca atom with 50 % probability, and by a vacancy with 5 % probability.\n[ {\"name\": \"C12\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"mass\": [12.0]} ]: any site with this species is occupied by a carbon isotope with mass 12.\n[ {\"name\": \"C13\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"mass\": [13.0]} ]: any site with this species is occupied by a carbon isotope with mass 13.\n[ {\"name\": \"CH3\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"C\"], \"concentration\": [1.0], \"attached\": [\"H\"], \"nattached\": [3]} ]: any site with this species is occupied by a methyl group, -CH3, which is represented without specifying precise positions of the hydrogen atoms.\nTo define how this property is stored for each of the frames in the trajectory the following properties have been defined:\n- **frame_serialization_format**:\n\n  - **Description**: To improve the compactness of the data there are several ways to show to which frame a value belongs.\n    This is specified by the :property:`frame_serialization_format`.\n  - **Type**: string\n  -
