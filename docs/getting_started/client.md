# Using the OPTIMADE client

This package includes a Python client that can be used to query multiple OPTIMADE APIs simultaneously, whilst automatically paginating through the results of each query.
The client can be used from the command-line (`optimade-get`), or called in Python code.

The client does not currently validate the returned data it comes back from the databases, and as some OPTIMADE APIs do not implement all features, it is worth paying attention to any error messages emitted by each database.

## Features

This list outlines the current and planned features for the client:

- [x] Query multiple OPTIMADE APIs simultaneously and asynchronously, with support for different endpoints, filters, sorting and response fields.
- [x] Automatically paginate through the results for each query.
- [x] Validate filters against the OPTIMADE grammar before they are sent to each database.
- [x] Count the number of results for a query without downloading them all.
- [x] Cache the results for queries to disk, and use them in future sessions without making new requests (achieved via callbacks).
- [ ] Valiate the results against the optimade-python-tools models and export into other supported formats (ASE, pymatgen, CIF, AiiDA).
- [ ] Enable asynchronous use in cases where there is already a running event loop (e.g., inside a Jupyter notebook).
- [ ] Support for querying databases indirectly via an [OPTIMADE gateway server](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/optimade-gateway).

## Installation

The client requires some extra dependencies that can be installed with the PyPI package with

```shell
pip install optimade[http_client]
```
or from a local copy of the repository with
```shell
pip install -e .[http_client]
```

## Usage

By default, the client will query all OPTIMADE API URLs that it can find via the [Providers list](https://providers.optimade.org):


=== "Command line"
    ```shell
    optimade-get --filter 'elements HAS "Ag"'
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient()
    results = client.get('elements HAS "Ag"')
    ```

At the command line, it may be immediately useful to redirect or save these results to a file:

```shell
# Save the results to a JSON file directly
optimade-get --filter 'elements HAS "Ag"' --output-file results.json
# or redirect the results (in a POSIX shell)
optimade-get --filter 'elements HAS "Ag"' > results.json
```

We can refine the search by manually specifying some URLs:

=== "Command line"
    ```shell
    optimade-get --output-file results.json https://optimade.fly.dev https://optimade.odbx.science
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient(
        base_urls=["https://optimade.fly.dev", "https://optimade.odbx.science"]
    )
    client.get()
    ```

or by including/excluding some providers by their registered IDs in the [Providers list](https://providers.optimade.org).

Query only a list of included providers (after a lookup of the providers list):

=== "Command line"
    ```shell
    # Only query databases served by the example providers
    optimade-get --include-providers exmpl,optimade
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Only query databases served by the example providers
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient(
        include_providers={"exmpl", "optimade"},
    )
    client.get()
    ```

Exclude certain providers:

=== "Command line"
    ```shell
    # Exclude example providers from global list
    optimade-get --exclude-providers exmpl,optimade
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Exclude example providers from global list
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient(
        exclude_providers={"exmpl", "optimade"},
    )
    client.get()
    ```

Exclude particular databases by URL:

=== "Command line"
    ```shell
    # Exclude specific example databases
    optimade-get --exclude-databases https://example.org/optimade,https://optimade.org/example
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Exclude specific example databases
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient(
        exclude_databases={"https://example.org/optimade", "https://optimade.org/example"}
    )
    client.get()
    ```

### Filtering

By default, an empty filter will be used (which will return all entries in a database).
You can specify your desired filter as follows (note the quotation marks):

=== "Command line"
    ```shell
    optimade-get --filter 'elements HAS "Ag" AND nsites < 2' --output-file results.json
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient()
    client.get('elements HAS "Ag" AND nsites < 2')
    ```

The filter will be validated against the `optimade-python-tools` reference grammar before it is sent to the underlying servers.

### Accessing the results

At the command-line, the results of the query will be printed to `stdout`, ready to be redirected to a file or piped into another program.
For example:

```shell
optimade-get --filter 'nsites = 1' --output-file results.json https://optimade.fly.dev
cat results.json
```

has the following (truncated) output:

```json
{
  // The endpoint that was queried
  "structures": {
    // The filter applied to that endpointk
    "nsites = 1": {
      // The base URL of the OPTIMADE API
      "https://optimade.fly.dev": {
        // The OPTIMADE API response as if called with an infinite `page_limit`
        "data": [
          {
            "id": "mpf_1",
            "type": "structures",
            "attributes": {
                ...
            }
            "relationships": {
                ...
            }
          },
          ...
        ],
        "errors": [],
        "links": {
          "next": null,
          "prev": null
        },
        "included": [
            ...
        ],
        "meta": {
            ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The response is broken down by queried endpoint, filter and then base URL so that the query URL can be easily reconstructed.
This is the same format as the cached results of the Python client:

```python
from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
client = OptimadeClient(base_urls="https://optimade.fly.dev")
client.get('nsites = 1')
client.get('nsites = 2')
print(client.all_results)
```

will return a dictionary with top-level keys:
```json
{
    "structures": {
        "nsites = 1": {
            "https://optimade.fly.dev": {...}
        },
        "nsites = 2": {
            "https://optimade.fly.dev": {...}
        }
    }
}
```

For a given session, this cache can be written and reloaded into an OPTIMADE client object to avoid needing to repeat queries.

!!! info
    In a future release, this cache will be automatically restored from disk and will obey defined cache lifetimes.

### Querying other endpoints

The client can also query other endpoints, rather than just the default `/structures` endpoint.
This includes any provider-specific `extensions/<example>` endpoints that may be implemented at a given base URL, which can be found listed at the corresponding `/info` endpoint for that database.

In the CLI, this is done with the `--endpoint` flag.
In the Python interface, the different endpoints can be queried as attributes of the client class or equivalently as a paramter to `client.get()` or `client.count()` (see below).

=== "Command line"
    ```shell
    optimade-get --endpoint "structures"
    optimade-get --endpoint "references"
    optimade-get --endpoint "info"
    optimade-get --endpoint "info/structures"
    optimade-get --endpoint "extensions/properties"
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient()

    client.references.count()
    client.count(endpoint="references")

    client.info.get()
    client.get(endpoint="info")

    client.info.structures.get()
    client.get(endpoint="info/structures")

    client.extensions.properties.get()
    client.get(endpoint="extensions/properties")
    ```

### Listing the properties served by a database

You can also retrieve the list of properties served by a database using the
`--list-properties` flag:

=== "Command line"
    ```
    optimade-get --list-properties structures --include-providers odbx
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient(include_providers={"odbx"})
    client.list_properties("structures")
    ```

and do simple string matching filtering of the response:

=== "Command line"
    ```
    optimade-get --list-properties structures --search-property gap
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient()
    client.list_properties("structures")
    ```

### Limiting the number of responses

Querying all OPTIMADE APIs without limiting the number of entries can result in a lot of data.
The client will limit the number of results returned per database to the value of `max_results_per_provider` (defaults: 1000 for Python, 10 for CLI).
This limit will be enforced up to a difference of the default page limit for the underlying OPTIMADE API (which is used everywhere).
This parameter can be controlled via the `--max-results-per-provider 10` at the CLI, or as an argument to `OptimadeClient(max_results_per_provider=10)`.

Setting this to a value of `-1` or `0` (or additionally `None`, if using the Python interface) will remove the limit on the number of results per provider.
In the CLI, this setting should be used alongside `--output-file` or redirection to avoid overflowing your terminal!

### Counting the number of responses without downloading

Downloading all the results for a given query can require hundreds or thousands of requests, depending on the number of results and the database's page limit.
It is possible to just count the number of results before downloading the entries themselves, which only requires 1 request per database.
This is achieved via the `--count` flag in the CLI, or the `.count()` method in the Python interface.
We can use this to repeat the queries from the [OPTIMADE paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00974-z):

=== "Command line"
    ```shell
    optimade-get \
        --count \
        --filter 'elements HAS ANY "C", "Si", "Ge", "Sn", "Pb"' \
        --filter 'elements HAS ANY "C", "Si", "Ge", "Sn", "Pb" AND nelements=2' \
        --filter 'elements HAS ANY "C", "Si", "Ge", "Sn" AND NOT elements HAS "Pb" AND elements LENGTH 3'
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient
    client = OptimadeClient()
    filters = [
        'elements HAS ANY "C", "Si", "Ge", "Sn", "Pb"',
        'elements HAS ANY "C", "Si", "Ge", "Sn", "Pb" AND nelements=2'
        'elements HAS ANY "C", "Si", "Ge", "Sn" AND NOT elements HAS "Pb" AND elements LENGTH 3'
    ]
    for f in filters:
        client.count(f)
    ```

which, at the timing of writing, yields the results:

```json
{
  "structures": {
    "elements HAS ANY \"C\", \"Si\", \"Ge\", \"Sn\", \"Pb\"": {

    }
  }
}
```

### Callbacks

In Python, the client can also be initialized with a list of callbacks.
These will be executed after every request and will have access to the JSON response and the request URL.

For example, callbacks be used, to save to a file or write to a database, without having to pull all the results into memory.
Care should be taken if combining an asynchronous client with callbacks, as the callbacks may depend on the execution order of various asynchronous requests and the callbacks themselves may be blocking.


=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Write a callback that saves into a MongoDB (fake or otherwise)
    import mongomock as pymongo
    from optimade.client import OptimadeClient

    db = pymongo.MongoClient().database.structures

    def write_to_db(url, results):
        for entry in results["data"]:
            entry.update(entry.pop("attributes"))
            entry["immutable_id"] = url
            db.insert_one(entry)

    client = OptimadeClient(callbacks=[write_to_db], silent=True)

    client.get()

    print(db.find_one())
    ```
