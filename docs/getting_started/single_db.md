# A single database

The [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org) uses `optimade-python-tools` alongside their existing API and MongoDB database, providing [OPTIMADE-compliant access](https://optimade.materialsproject.org) to highly-curated density-functional theory calculations across all known inorganic materials.

`optimade-python-tools` handles filter parsing, database query generation and response validation by running the reference server implementation with minimal configuration.
